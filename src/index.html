			<h2>Red Velvet Cupcakes</h2>
			<p>Vibrant and festive red velvet cupcakes combine moist cake with classic cream cheese frosting for a
				stunning
				individually-sized dessert. Easy to make and fun to decorate with a swirl of frosting and cake crumbles!
			</p>
			<p>Red velvet cupcakes have a lightly flavored chocolate cake batter that’s both moist and beautiful and
				made
				with
				simple ingredients. Red velvet combines cocoa powder and buttermilk for a distinctive taste that
				balances
				sweetness with the tang of buttermilk and rich cream cheese frosting. Red food coloring gives these tiny
				cakes a
				festive and bright scarlet hue.</p>

			<h3>Next, Follow the 8 Steps Below:</h3>
			<img src="images/Screenshot 2025-02-05 at 5.04.50 PM.png" alt="" />
			<p>1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Place 16 cupcake liners in cupcake pans. In a large bowl or the bowl of a
				stand
				mixer, sift the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, and baking soda together. Add the salt and
				give
				it a
				whisk to combine.</p>

			<p>2. Cut the room-temperature butter into tablespoon-sized pieces, then add to the flour mixture. Using a
				paddle
				attachment, mix on low until a sandy mixture forms.</p>

			<p>3. In another bowl, combine the eggs, buttermilk, vanilla, and food coloring. Use 1 to 2 tablespoons of
				liquid
				food coloring or 5 to 6 drops of gel food coloring.</p>

			<p>4. Whisk the wet ingredients together until a consistent color is achieved.</p>

			<p>5. Slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients while mixing on low speed. Mix until combined,
				stopping
				to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.</p>

			<p>6. Distribute the batter evenly into cupcake papers. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until springy to the
				touch.
				Let
				cool for a few minutes in the pans then remove and cool completely on a wire rack.</p>

			<p>7. In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the
				butter on
				medium speed until smooth and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the room-temperature cream cheese, vanilla,
				and
				salt
				to the creamed butter. Beat together on medium speed until well combined. Scrape down the bowl. With the
				mixer
				on low speed, add the sifted confectioners’ sugar a cup at a time. Mix until combined. If you want a
				stiffer
				buttercream, keep adding more sifted confectioners’ sugar until it’s the desired texture, or chill the
				frosting
				for a few minutes before piping.</p>

			<p>8. Transfer the frosting to a piping bag fitted with a star tip and pipe large dollops on top of each
				cooled
				cupcake.</p>
			<h3>Enjoy!</h3>
