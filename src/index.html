	<h2>Next, Follow the 8 Steps Below:</h2>
	<img src="images/Screenshot 2025-02-05 at 5.04.50 PM.png" alt="" />
	<p>1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Place 16 cupcake liners in cupcake pans. In a large bowl or the bowl of a stand
		mixer, sift the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, and baking soda together. Add the salt and give it a
		whisk to combine.</p>

	<p>2. Cut the room-temperature butter into tablespoon-sized pieces, then add to the flour mixture. Using a paddle
		attachment, mix on low until a sandy mixture forms.</p>

	<p>3. In another bowl, combine the eggs, buttermilk, vanilla, and food coloring. Use 1 to 2 tablespoons of liquid
		food coloring or 5 to 6 drops of gel food coloring.</p>

	<p>4. Whisk the wet ingredients together until a consistent color is achieved.</p>

	<p>5. Slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients while mixing on low speed. Mix until combined, stopping
		to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.</p>

	<p>6. Distribute the batter evenly into cupcake papers. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until springy to the touch. Let
		cool for a few minutes in the pans then remove and cool completely on a wire rack.</p>

	<p>7. In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter on
		medium speed until smooth and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the room-temperature cream cheese, vanilla, and salt
		to the creamed butter. Beat together on medium speed until well combined. Scrape down the bowl. With the mixer
		on low speed, add the sifted confectioners’ sugar a cup at a time. Mix until combined. If you want a stiffer
		buttercream, keep adding more sifted confectioners’ sugar until it’s the desired texture, or chill the frosting
		for a few minutes before piping.</p>

	<p>8. Transfer the frosting to a piping bag fitted with a star tip and pipe large dollops on top of each cooled
		cupcake.</p>
	<h2>Pro Tips For Making This Recipe</h2>
	<p>Weigh the ingredients using a kitchen scale. A kitchen scale provides the most accurate measurement, especially
		for flour. Place the bowl of your mixer on the scale and use the tare function to zero out the weight. Set or
		hold the sifter over the bowl to easily measure each dry ingredient and save time!</p>
	<p>Richer chocolate variation. If you prefer a stronger chocolate taste, you can add additional cocoa powder up to 2
		tablespoons to the cupcake batter or you can substitute part of the cocoa powder with dark cocoa powder. Note
		that this will deepen the color and make the baked cupcakes appear less red. I recommended adding an addition
		tablespoon of milk if increasing the cocoa to 2 tablespoons.</p>
	<p>Personalize the color. Use 1 to 2 tablespoons of liquid food coloring or 5 to 6 drops of gel food coloring to
		achieve a vibrant red color, or add more coloring for a richer red.</p>
	<p>Avoid stains. Keep in mind that food coloring will stain hands, linens, and surfaces quickly, so replace the lid
		promptly and use a damp paper towel to wipe any drips or splatters.</p>
	<p>Make your own sour milk. If you don’t have buttermilk, you can still make this recipe! Use whole milk and add a
		little less than 1 tablespoon of white vinegar or lemon juice to the milk and allow it to sit for a few minutes
		and curdle before using.</p>
	<p>Add more confectioners’ sugar for stiffer frosting. If you like your cream cheese frosting to be stiffer, add
		additional confectioners’ sugar until the frosting is your ideal consistency.</p>
	<p>Decorate with cupcake crumbles. Crumble one cupcake and use it to decorate the frosting. If you prefer a brighter
		red crumble garnish, add additional red food coloring to one cupcake before baking and stir to combine using a
		toothpick.</p>
